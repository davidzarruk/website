          Housing crises are characterized by an increase in foreclosure rates that generate losses to mortgage investors. To preserve
their solvency, governments have historically implemented two policies: a) offer bailouts to investors (Wall Street), and b) offer
subsidies to mortgage refinancing of households to prevent additional foreclosures (Main Street). This paper studies the welfare
maximizing bailout-subsidy policy for the case of the Great Recession, shaped by two frictions: a dead-weight loss of 20% on the
house value that occurs during the foreclosure process and an information friction on individual house prices that generates
strategic default to access subsidy programs. I quantitatively assess the welfare maximizing policy in a heterogeneous agents’
economy and find that a subsidy-only policy would have generated welfare gains of up to 0.4%, measured as consumption
equivalent variation, as compared to the baseline calibration that matches TARP and HAMP programs implemented during the
Great Recession. In contrast, a bailout-only policy would have generated welfare losses of 0.8%.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;margin-right: 1.5cm;color:black;text-align: justify;font-size:16px;"> Parallel computing opens the door to solving and estimating richer models in Economics. From dynamic optimization
problems with high dimensionality to structural estimation with complex data, readily-available and economical parallel
computing allows researchers to tackle problems in Economics that were beyond the realm of possibility just a decade ago. This
paper describes the basics of parallel computing for economists, reviews widely-used implementation routines in Julia, Python,
R, Matlab, C++ (OpenMP and MPI) and CUDA and compares performance gains using as a test bed a standard life-cycle problem
such as those used in macro, labor, and other fields. </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;margin-right: 1.5cm;color:black;text-align: justify;font-size:16px;"> This paper characterizes the general equilibrium outcomes of the tertiary education market in a context where borrowing
constraints bind, there is a two-tier college system operating under monopolistic competition in which colleges differ by quality
and returns to education depend on school quality. The paper shows that a widening of the gap in quality supplied by tertiary
education institutions can be a by-product of subsidized student loan policies and illustrates the main results through a numerical
exercise applied to the case of Colombia, which underwent a rapid expansion in the supply of subsidized student loans during
the past decade. </p>
